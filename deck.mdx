# SSR Optimization

---

# Who am I?

---

# Pedro Filho

## Software Engineer at Blockchain.com

---

# SSR is a blessing 🙌

---

# What is SSR?

---

## Generate on the server and render on the browser

---

# What does it give you?

---

## Performance 🔥

---

## SEO-Friendly 👀

---

# But it's also a curse ☠️

---

# Let's see why

---

# Metrics for Blockchain.com

---

### Main source of blockchain transactions in the web

### 10M+ page views per month

### 25 thick servers running the application (with CPU going to the sky)

---

# /explorer

---

### Everything on the server

### Computation heavy data (at least for JS)

---

# How we fixed it?

---

### Fastify for the win (we had a custom server)

### Made the application stateless (no session memory)

### Cluster mode with multiple instances

### Client-sided what we could (without any "crawlable" data removed)

---

# Results

---

import i from "./cto-message-after.jpeg";

<img
  style={{
    width: "500px",
    height: "auto",
  }}
  src={i}
/>

---

### Improved our performance in 90%+

### Decreased the amount from 25 servers to 4

---

# Tips

---

### Maybe use serverless, if you don't want to deal with all this

### Don't use all your cores, it'll be unstable
